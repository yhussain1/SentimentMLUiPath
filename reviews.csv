"This is a lovely LOVELY keyboard but be warned it will take you some getting used to. The keys seem a little high compared to my other keyboards and the keys themselves seem a little closer together. The escape key is not the corner key I am usually expecting in that position. That space is taken up by one of the macro keys.

You WILL get used to this in time, the more you use it but this is an amazing keyboard. It worked as soon as I plugged it in and I didnt have to bother installing any software (apparently theres something you can download to make the light dance differently). I actually have the lights turned off as I find them a distraction. Now I know where the keys are I am able to find them in the dark.
Dont get me wrong they are beautiful lights but just not for me.

No problem typing and Im not getting any problems in games either with the keyboard locking up or any other nonsense that my older, cheaper, keyboard did. Yes this is pricey, but worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I work in costumer support and I am a typer, I had a basic dell keyboard for years and I am pretty happy with it, I wanted try the macro keys to make my job easier, however, it did not turn out as I expected and here is why.
Cons
1 - If you are buying this for macro keys the macro keys are right beside Shift-Caps-Ctrl buttons, everytime you want to reach to this buttons your finger goes and hits the macro buttons because those buttons shift,caps,ctrl etc buttons are on the edge of the keyboard that is what your hand and finger is used for years now the edge buttons are macro keys that very close to them so you will keep hitting them always, especially when you want to use ctrl+c or Ctrl+v , when you have this keyboard you will start looking at your keyboard to make sure you are not pressing on macro key :) :) so I wish these macro keys were at the Top of the F buttons where there is a huge space there for them.
2- Keys has more dept in other words too tall keys and keys are close to each other , when you are typing lifting your finger from a deep key hole and move to another key hole is difficult so you fingers keeps hitting other keys when moving arround, you dont face this problem if the keys are half length of these buttons. Keys are quite loud too, if you are working at home and dont want to wake up your family in the middle of night with keyboard sound do not buy this. I never had this problem with my simple dell keyboard.
3 -The led lights bleed out from each key and the software and hardware are not stable, you set something and then it works 1 munites and then dont work again, lights to turn off itself I dont know why and how, before installing software I was able to switch rgb lights with F(function) button but after installing software I cannot do that anymore means those settings are only available true software from the moment you install it. and it does not work quite well and stable.

Pros
- The software interface for macro is good and easy to use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Absolutely love this keyboard. Yes it's membrane but it feels good quality and I prefer it over overly clicky keyboards which sets off my sensory overload. This one does not. I used to have the first version of it which is still like brand new but wanted the second version because of the seperate light colour instead of sections. It does not disappoint. Outstanding Corsair and at a really good price too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
This keyboard is great except if you pour water on it lol for the short time I used this keyboard the way it was laid out was good with the excellent build quality,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So this keyboard feels great the lights do what you ask of them. Not a noisy action on the keys and they press well.
Yet mine broke a few months after buying and for no reason at all, I woke up turned the PC on, and could not enter my start-up code essentially locking me out of my system. I had to find an old keyboard to enter the code to use the PC.
I contacted Amazon as I bought it here and at first was told to contact the manufacturer. That was an unacceptable answer as this would take a week or a few to solve.
I explained this to the kind man in customer services and he was fantastic about it. I got a replacement the next day and shipped the broken one back.
Wonderful job by Amazon and I have the keyboard I wanted rather than a refund.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought this as a gift for my gf.

After using her computer I decided I had to get my own one.

I use this for work about 7 hours a day. I have had 5 months and other than the dust it has accumulated, it look and works brand new. None of the letters are scratched (and remember I said I have used this for 5 months 7 hours a day)

I would defiantly recommend. This is every comfortable keyboard and types and feels perfect.

As I said I use this for work. The 6 macro keys on the left are an amazing aspect and I use these countless times a day for tasks I repeat. (There is a task at work that believe it or not I can complete 4 hours before the average person just because of those amazing macro keys.

The only problem I have with this is that you need to have ICUE! running in the background the manually ick the colours you want. Other than this it's great. The default colours are good anyways so not too bad.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This keyboard is not for me, decided to try it after using a slimline keyboards for years. I find this keyboard incredibly awkward to use and not a pleasant typing experience. Constantly catching fingers on the other keys due to the elevated position of them and the much longer travel than I am used to. I know some like that feel but it adds nothing to the typing experience for me other than your fingers get tired from typing much quicker.

The selling points for me had been the backlighting and macro keys both of which are a complete disappointment.

Maybe I'm just not the right market for all this RGB stuff, but I've never understand the need to have your computer and accessories glowing all colours of the rainbow. I just wanted to be able to have a simple colour for a backlight. When I first plugged this keyboard in I was dazzled by the crazy strobing rainbow effect it adopts by default, which is massively distracting I really don't need my keyboard to be giving me a light show. The options appear to be either turn off the lights completely using the light button on the keyboard or install the iCue bloatware. I went with the latter the options in here are then you can either apply a lighting effect which basically allows you to choose some irritating pattern for the lights to flash at you in or choose hardware lighting which will set a static colour. By fudging the lighting settings you can effectively make the pattern be a static colour but it's clearly not the idea.

The lighting effects only work when you have their software running as do the macros. All massively pointless and overkill for me. Returned and ordered a slimline Cherry keyboard that already has the additional buttons such as calculator that I need.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"This is a great keyboard, and when you fork out a ton of money on a keyboard you'd expect no less. There are a few issues I have with this though. For RGB it might not be as customisable as you'd think

*** Pro's ***
- The keyboard comes with a rest for your wrists which is an amazing feature as it prevents you from getting strain or uncomfortable hands
- The keyboard offers RGB customisability that can be synced with the iCue system giving you the option to have profiles for the RGB colours
- The keyboard has macro buttons that you can map on the iCue software to create complex macros and simple macros
- Keyboard comes with volume control which allows you to skip songs, pause them, and increase total computer volume
- Keys feel nice to use even though they're not mechanical
- Quite a large keyboard but it's perfect for an optimal keyboard layout

*** Con’s ***
- Even though it has RGB, it's not as customisable as you'd expect, instead of having each key able to be mapped out it has 3 sections that work as one mappable area each
- The keys aren't mechanical and for the price it should be, might be worth spending a little extra to get a better keyboard in my opinion

Areas to improve:
- Make it so that every key on the keyboard is able to be mapped as a separate LED
- Make the keyboard mechanical instead of the weird thing that it is so the option to swap out switches is available

I love this keyboard, and even though it might not be my dream keyboard it works very very well. The macros are useful and they're something I use in my every day life, and I find the RGB lights to be a nice addition.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I mainly needed a quiet keyboard, as I am on a student exchange program and the walls here are paper thin. This keyboard has done its job well. The lighting is pretty awesome, I just find the actual app a little confusing to use, but that may just be me.

I got it for a great price and it was definitely worth my money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had this keyboard for about 11 months now, and I'm generally happy with it. It's pretty comfortable to use, and the wrist rest provides good support. The macro keys are useful for a variety of operations.

There are two issues:
1. I notice that the black on a couple of the keys is starting to wear off. Based on my experience with other (cheaper) keyboards, I would have expected this to last for longer.
2. The wrist rest collects dirt like there's no tomorrow.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"It's a great keyboard, feels great and types well and I absolutely love the colour changing on it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought it for £41.99 in November 2017. Been using it since then, every day, for anywhere from a few hours to all day. Finally decided to look for a mechanical keyboard. Every single key still works. Satisfying to type with. Absolutely love the macro keys (something it's bafflingly difficult to find on mechanicals). Extra keys like the volume/media control keys and the Windows lock are useful. Despite some dust as of typing this, if I cleaned it up it would probably look as good as new.

I only have two issues. One (the one I knock off a star for) is that there are issues with the iCUE software/keyboard drivers that means the software doesn't always recognise the keyboard when you boot the PC, meaning that the lighting profiles and macro keys don't work properly without unplugging/replugging. Second is a very minor gripe - I find that the rubber grip/rest at the bottom collects sweat really easily, so it goes white and can be surprisingly difficult to clean. On the plus side, it does grip well, so I can't really complain.

All in all, if you're on a budget, or just cheap, both of which I was when I bought this, I don't think you could go wrong. 4 years of constant use and a damn good keyboard, for very little.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I was looking for an upgrade from my 60% mechanical keyboard and was originally tried logitech before price threw me off. I bought this as it seemed like a good mid-range keyboard and was surprised by the value you get from the price.

Just a few notes;

-Amazing build quality with tactile switches. (obviously not hot-swappable but still very nice)
-6 Programable Keys using the ICue program which itself is much less demanding then others (*Razer Synapse*)
-Wrist rest is detachable. Insanely huge plus and what put this as 5 star instead of 4.
-The actual USB cable is a good length which is always appreciated.

Downsides;

-It is a very large keyboard, which won't affect some but if you're lacking desk space like myself, it is pretty massive compared to other 100% keyboards.
-Very simple RGB with minimal customisation (nothing like Razer but still very good for half the price)

Either way if you're looking for a good mid-range keyboard and don't want to spend a ton, this is a great keyboard and one that'll definitely last.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"JANUARY 2022 UPDATE: do an Internet search on ""Corsair keyboard indicator light keeps flashing"" and you'll see that this manufacturer has had problems in that regard FOR YEARS.

Corsair knows there is a fundamental weakness in its product because its user forums are notable for the number of appeals for help from frustrated purchasers, but has pretty obviously done nothing about it otherwise the problem(s) wouldn't persist. Its online help makes little sense and the user forums are even worse.

I originally recommended this 100% in August 2021 as a 5 star buy. Now in January 2022 I should not have to go through all kinds of silly hoops to fix a known longstanding fault. On that basis therefore, the 5 star rating is cancelled and the recommendation with it.
I'm going to have to stick black insulating tape over the flashing indicator as it's driving me nuts. Unsatisfactory performance by a manufacturer of supposed quality.
MORAL OF THE STORY: A keyboard review is only worth taking note of if written after at least 6 months' usage. Mea culpa for being much much too premature in singing Corsair's praises.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to Amazon's outstanding customer service and Amazon Warehouse value for money pricing, I at last have a keyboard with an excellent user touch, little noise, effective illumination and quick access audio controls -- the four features I'd been seeking for quite a while.

My original choice, a Redragon K503, proved a major disappointment and pretty much unusable due to its poor engineering: the lefthandside CTRL key, positioned just below the lefthandside SHIFT, was actually higher. Time and again I'd intend to hit SHIFT but instead catch the raised edge of CTRL. If typing anything online, the work was instantly lost along with all the time and effort put into it.

No such problem exists with the superb Corsair K55 / UK keyboard version. Key spacing and key positioning are exactly right, whilst elsewhere the instant access audio control keys are perfect for the job (the Redragon version couldn't even be bothered to include a Mute key).

I had originally considered the Corsair but its price was just a little too much for my pocket at that time.
Thanks to Amazon, however, I was able to return the unfit-for-purpose Redragon and was immediately refunded. By happy coincidence, the superior Corsair offering was suddenly made available from Amazon Warehouse, absolutely as new, with some very minor damage only to the outer packaging. I therefore paid less than half the retail price for this keyboard, and less than the dysfunctional Redragon K503 had cost, too.

As one who isn't into computer gaming, I can't speak for how good a 'gaming keyboard' this might be. I can say, however, that for working silently at home of an evening, or catching up on emails and similar written stuff, the K55 is an absolute joy. Setting up was easy and took no more than a couple of minutes, during which time I selected a pale blue lighting for all the 'zones' of the keyboard and made that color choice, permanent. The lighting is visible in daytime and in low light and at night is very attractive; if there's an off-on switch, I haven't found it yet, but it suits me to have the board light up whenever the computer boots up and to switch off when closing down.

Being a membrane, there's none of the feedback to be expected from mechanical boards. But then, there's none of the noise, either. Someone else on this review thread has mentioned the keyboard's 'crunchines', an alleged sound/sensation that almost put me off acquiring this. However, there's nothing like any 'crunchiness' on the K55 I have, neither in terms of touch or sound. The user experience in my case is one of soundless smoothness.

As to touch, Corsair has engineered a satisfying amount of key travel into the board, so that it feels lively and responsive, unlike the numb feedback from cheaper boards (especially of the non-gaming variety).

It's early days yet, but as I undertake a lot of detailed typing every day / night, I can say that this Corsair is a true class-act -- as is Amazon UK, too, for the way it dealt with my earlier disappointment and for enabling me, via Amazon Warehouse, to obtain this superior keyboard at a such a great value-for-money price.

100% recommended.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like this keyboard, you can fully customise the colour of the backlight and you can set the macro keys down the side to do all sorts of things. It's very useful for gaming etc.
However, when I have the backlight on the brighter settings, there is a very high pitched electronic whine that comes from the keyboard. Probably wouldn't bother most people but my hearing is very sensitive. The noise goes away if you have it on the lowest brightness so it isn't too much of a problem.
Another issue I'm having is that dust and small particles can fall into the area under the keys, the space that lights up, so you can see when a speck of something has fallen in but you can't get to it. I am going to have to try to either vaccuum these out, or take off the keys to clean it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"For the K55 PRO XT model

Keys
The keys are not mechanical, but they have a pretty good feeling to them when pressing down, also quite responsive. They are not loud at all if this is one of your concerns. The keyboard is also packed with 6x macro keys, which can be handy for some people who are into MMOs and streamers. Definitely better than ordinary £10-20 keyboard.

Size and Comfort
The keyboard is really big. Especially if have the wrist rest attached, which is quite comfortable if you ask me. The wrist rest is made out of silicon-ish material so its not the smoothest and can get dirty pretty quick, but easy to clean as it can be removed easily.

RGB + Software
RGB lighting is really nice and looks much better compare to other £40-60 keyboards. It requires the ICUE software to run on your PC to make the most out of it. Luckily it barely put any strains on your system, so probably no issue for most people.
Worth mentioning. The Software might not recognize the keyboard at first. Updating/ Newly downloading and restarting the PC helped me. I seen others had the similar issue. There are few solution this issue is quiet common among K55 keyboards

My Experience with the K55 PRO XT
I have this keyboard for 2 moths by now and there have been no MAJOR issues with it. After a few weeks the numlock indicator light went off and the left arrow key had a different rgb colour but was fixed with upgrading firmware and restarting the pc.

I recommend buying this product but only when discounted. The £70 price tag is bit expensive for the K55 PRO XT model.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is a great keyboard, my fave features are described below, but the one thing I hate about it might be a show-stopper for some people, so I'll describe that first:

The key labels are all upside down!! What I mean is that, on 99.999% of other keyboards, the shifted thing is above the normal thing. For example, press '=' for equals, and usually, above that is the shift-thing, in this case '+'. See the photo attached - all the legends are the other way up! For most keys, this doesn't matter much, but for +/= and maybe for some, : / ; will be confusing. I have been typing for over 40 years, and it throws me off on this keyboard!

However, I still think it's a great keyboard because:
- It's quiet! Maybe not as quiet as a thin membrane keyboard, but for a full-travel keyboard it's very quiet. Finally I can type while my partner is sleeping in the next room. No clatter of the space bar! Marvellous!

- It's lighted - with so many options, and so easily controlled without software! I also love that there is a dedicated key to adjust the brightness or turn off the backlight. Great! Another good thing about backlighted keyboards is that the keys themselves have transparent letters so the light shows through. This means that the legends will not wear off when, like me, I forget to cut my nails short. The number of keyboards I have worn the letters off is too many to count. This one will survive! Gonna be great in the winter when it's dark.

_ Just to be clear - you cannot control the colour of an individual key - there are 4 zones left to right that you can change the colour of... so that may not suit all, but I have solid colour across the whole thing - different one each day to switch things up a bit!

- It's got 6 programmable keys that you don't need software for - record those key sequences right on the keyboard - amazing and so easy to do!

- It's got media controls, the most important two being Mute and pause - for when the phone rings and when it's time to stop annoying other people!

So, in general, it's the keybaord I have been waiting for for years.... except for this upside-down shift legend thing. Oh, and the num lock LED is BRIGHT.

If they re-did this keyboard with the legend as it is on all the other keyboards, then I would buy loads of these to use for the rest of my life!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"For its price, its a good keyboard. It might not be the most quiet, but writing, it feels comfortable and nice. The space bar isn't the best but usable. Good amounts of options on the backlight.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Nice feel to the keyboard and the lighting is good. I'm taking one star off as the key action is slightly clunky for fast typing for me and the mappable keys on the left are a pain as I keep hitting the top one instead of escape. Will probably get used to it.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The keys have good enough travel for gaming but also not too much travel for typing, so the keyboard is pretty good for both.

The main issue I have is that it is quite wide and I don't have the biggest hands, so sometimes I have to look at it to reposition my hands correctly before resuming touch typing. I find I also have to offset its position to the left instead of having it centered for the same reason.

But it is a good keyboard which I hope will last a good while.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"A good quality membrane keyboard that is OK for gaming as long as you aren't too rough with it.
I bought it more for simulators and general use and one of the main reasons for choosing this keyboard were the 6 macro keys. Those keys were simple and straightforward to set up, as were the lighting effects which I am continually messing about with - the variations and effects seem to be limitless. It does everything that I want and because of the quality of materials used it should last for years.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this keyboard after about a year using mechanics.

What can I say...
Well, let's start with a bit of a description
So this one has volume keys on the right, g1-g6 gaming macro keys on the left. 3 zone illumination.
Aaand it's a membrane keyboard.

Pros:
It's quet. I mean compared to a mechanic, finally I can be at ease typing at night. Nice.
It will be probably durable as hell.
It has the media keys in the right place

Cons:
Well, after using the mech for some time I must admit I prefer typing on a mech.
the volume control is not a knob

Why did I switch in the first place?
Well, I was using a redragon first. That started having issues after a month. Luckily redragon added like 10 spare switches, which you can replace on the fly. That should've been a hint, that they might go quickly but oh well, I did not get that. I am not a subtle man... Anyway, in about 8 months I went through 10 switches in my wsad area and decided I needed a replacement.

So I bought a logitech. I thought a reputable brand would be better. Damn... After about 6 months the LED under the 8 key went. Then the switches under the 4 key and under wsad started registering two keys instead of one. Only Logitech did not include any spares in the package, and you cannot replace them on the fly.

So I thought - wait a minute, I still have my old membrane keyboard I bought 9 years ago and that works perfectly. Mechs are clearly crap, I need a membrane keyboard. And I bought this one.

So typing is nice, quick and quiet. Not as good as on the mech, but I'll get used to it.

I am happy with the purchase, so far. We'll se how it goes. If this one breaks after a few months I will update this review. For now, 5 stars",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Have been looking for a decent keyboard for the office due to always wearing off the letters off the keys with heavy use. Thought rgb would be a good idea but has been hard to find something suitable for office work as gaming keyboards tend to be oversized and good ones overpriced.
This has been a excellent replacement for a standard office keyboard and at a great price. Very Happy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is not a mechanical keyboard, rather it is a more standard rubber-dome type keyboard with a membrane interface, rather than individual mechanical switches. The build quality is good and the visual appearance of the keyboard is also good. Seems durable. I like the RGB lighting and how it can be customised and set up to light up in different patterns. Rainbow effect for example. I also like how you can just choose one whole colour for the entire keyboard, to be in keeping with other peripherals such as a mouse..
The key feel is quite good and tactile for a rubber dome, allowing quick and easy typing and moderate gaming. I wouldn't however recommend this keyboard for high precision or high speed gaming, as the keys can feel mushy if constantly spammed.
Good quality keyboard for the money, especially if you have other corsair components in your PC or a Corsair mouse, so as to keep the computer setup looking uniform.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Perfectly functional keyboard but useless for myself as I use a dual computer setup for work/personal use. I connect my keyboard to a USB switcher so I can switch my most used peripherals between the too without hassle. This keyboard demands too much power and even with an external power source the the switcher it will sometimes spam out the same key 80 times or just refuse to acknowledge you are typing at all for a few seconds.

Going to gift this to a friend as the keyboard works fine when connected directly to either machine",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Very good keyboard, has a nice feel to it. Doesn't feel cheap or anything and has a selection of RGB customisation to it via iCue software. The custom ""macro"" keys are useful for binding shortcuts to like screen recording, screenshots, open application etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"So the keyboard itself is nice - works fine. Lights are okay however the button layout is a bit annoying.

The G buttons right now are pointless to me, I keep pushing them instead of CTRL because of their position and the esc keys along with the F keys are sunk down a bit making it super annoying to find them while playing unless you raise the keyboard slightly and even then it's a little bit annoying. I guess it's something you have to get used too but that's just my heads up. Other than that good keyboard!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this keyboard, not for gaming, but for key back-lighting due to it sometimes being dark round my desk on overcast days.

From a lighting point of view, it is great. Unlike a previous keyboard which failed to fully illuminate the 'shift' characters (such as those on the main row of numbers) this one is clear and the custom function takes you through a nice range of fixed colours and adjustable brightness to fit the ambient light. There seems to be an undocumented key combination that switches off all the lights. I managed this once and the cat also managed it while walking over the bottom left corner of the keys!

For those used to standard keyboards, the macro key location might be an issue. Your muscle memory expects Caps Lock, Shift and Ctrl to be leftmost. This is where the macro keys are and it has taken a long time to train my hand position to essentially ignore those keys.

The biggest issue is the layout of the keys with shift options e.g. % on the 5 key, * on 8, ( on 9 etc. On every keyboard I have used, those symbols appear above the numbers. Your brain is wired to the simple rule, hold Shift to go to the secondary symbol above. On this keybaord, for reasons I can't fathom, they are under the main character. Maybe it's some kind of in joke for gamers.

At the end of the day, it's a keybaord, solidly built and does it's job well with the added benefits (for me, at least) of the lighting and macro keys. If you just want a basic keyboard, with a properly marked keys then probably you need to look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this as my G15s had finally died. I find this a great keyboard, the keys have good clear strike feel and typing is great. It took me an hour or so to adjust to the new feel and now I type with less errors than my old G15. The wrist wrest is fine, I kind of like the almost solid plastic feel as I am not a fan of a rubbery wrist wrest. Overall it does what it says and with the iCUE (from Corsair) software you have full control over things like the macro keys and lighting.

One thing it does not do that my G15s did was have profiles for the macro keys that changed with each game. With the K55 you have 6 macro keys and that's it, they are fixed with whatever you program them with (at least that's what I am finding).

Ong good feature is the ability to disable the Windows key when gaming using the little lock button on the top (and if you use the software you can make this also disable Alt-F4).

The two negatives I have is that the text for some buttons is too small for my old eyes (all the non letter or number keys especially) , and the Shift text is shown at the bottom on the keys, not the top (confusing). So 4 stars.

I would buy this keyboard again, unless there was an non RGB version that cost less and then I would buy that :)",4.0 out of 5 stars
"After I spilled a drink on my old and beloved Corsair Raptor K30, I was tempted to try get an exact replacement. To my dismay, it seems that was discontinued. I'm not a fan of buying things such as peripherals used. So I was left with finding an alternative, and upgrade of sorts.

I don't just play games, but I also produce my own music and use a lot of content creation as well as productivity software. So I really needed a keyboard with macro keys like the K30, but also, because I have a lot of other Corsair RGB products (like they're case fans and a Sabre RGB mouse)--I figured it was time to buy an RGB keyboard.

So we're here. At the time of writing this review, I've been using it for a couple of months.

I'm not sure how others feel about crunchy keys, but that's the only way I can describe them, and I like that crunchiness.

Although you can set the zones and lighting from the keyboard, I prefer to use the iCUE software since I can sync and colour-match with the aforementioned mouse and fans. It took awhile getting used to only six G-keys, where before I had the ability to essentially assign 18 macros with the older K30 (6 G-keys, 3 memory banks on the K30).

One small detail. You have to be careful with the clip/s of the wrist when attaching or detaching/reattaching. I broke one of them on the first day of getting the keyboard. Corsair doesn't seem to offer replacement wrist rests for the K55--does for the K65/70 and above. I, however, fortunately have a 3D printer--and someone on Thingiverse created a replacement/repair part that I was able to print.

In the end, though. I don't regret my purchase at all. Feels nice, looks like, plays/works nice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great keyboard arm rest lights up gaming button in case you hit windows key while gameing happens a lot lights up well and icue softhwrere you have to download is a bit tricky to use but all in all great,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Edit: -1 star as mine has developed the issue where the numlock and caps lock lights stop working randomly. The keys still work when this happens but it is still slightly annoying. I've tried re-flashing the firmware, disabling power saving options in device manager and disabled usb suspend settings in power management. Issue still persists. I'll update if I can find a fix!
Edit 2: The problem is related to USB connections. Basically, if you unplug or insert usb devices regularly, then this causes the capslock/numlock light to freeze on or off. If you hardly ever do this then you won't be affected as much. Waiting on a firmware update from corsair.
.
Really nice keyboard, the keys have a nice weight to them and aren't too loud.. for me.
The RGB aspect lets you set the colour to whatever you have going on in your rig and now has CUE support which lets you control the RGB colours and brightness through software.
I use a static colour mostly but I needed to tweak the brightness for certain colour configs as they were too bright for me at night. CUE is pretty sweet, make sure to update your firmware when prompted as the latest FM has ironed some bugs out.
The only annoying thing is that on startup you may be get a single USB disconnect sound when running CUE. Hopefully this will be fixed at a later update but it doesn't affect usage of the keyboard and doesn't bother me too much. Without CUE running this doesn't happen.
The RGB presets for the keyboard can be changed without CUE by using the FN key and a specific number, but you only get 3 brightness presets which I found to be a bit lacking.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my first membrane keyboard and I love it, I play lots of FPS games and I have used the macro keys for them and they are improving my skills loads like in BF, COD & Siege. My KD has significantly gone up in all 3 games. The Macro keys are very easy to set up and the media controls are very handy to have. The clip on wrist rest is not very comfortable to me so I have kept that in the box.

I love how easy it is to change the colours on the keyboard, don't even need any extra software its all done by using the FN key & numbers.
Only bad thing for me with this keyboard is the orange colour setting, the pictures I've attached the first one is on orange mode (looks yellow to me) & the second one is section 1 in yellow & section 2 in red and I wish I could have that orange colour in the middle of them but I just have the keyboard on rainbow effect now as I thought it would bother me while playing games but dose not at all.

Have been trying to find out where to register the keyboard for warranty but asked Corsair live chat & they said keep ahold of the reciept and any problems with item just open a RMA with them, they give you 2 years warranty.

Fantastic keyboard for only £20! Used an AMEX offer to get it that price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I wanted a basic replacement keyboard, and that is what I have got. The keys are easy for touch typing, and the programmable six keys are very useful. Volume, brightness, and playback keys are also simple to use. Backlit keys is a bit misleading though, as the lights show from underneath and around the keys, rather than through them, which looks rather tacky. For basic gameplay it's fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Keyboard is quiet enough and less clicky than a mechanical one. Seems to be fast enough on most games (FPS & Flight Simulator mainly so far) & nice to type with too. Backlighting is great & although not fully customisable (per key) it is certainly customisable enough for my needs. Great to have the separate brightness key & media keys too. Wrist rest is ok too, although easily removed if you don't like it. Macro keys are great :) Decent weight and quality. It needs to be plugged into a proper USB port, not a hub, or it won't behave properly and can make a whistling sound!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"It is a good keyboard overall, but I've got a few gripes:

The placement of the programmable keys is awful. So counterintuitive to not have Escape at the top left corner or Ctrl on the bottom left.

The volume controls never worked properly. Not a massive deal but would have been better if they worked out-of-the-box.

The wrist rest is too hard to be useful, and it makes the keyboard absolutely gigantic. Removed it straight away and find it more comfortable without it.

The fact that it doesn't have a USB port at the back, given its size is also a bit of a shock.

Other than the above, it is very comfortable to type and game. Not too noisy either.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The K55 is a nice keyboard but as a left handed gamer the wrist rest is slightly too short, however this is ususally the case on most keyboards. What I mean is that for general typing or using WSAD to control games the wrist rest is in a good location, but when using the arrow keys you position your hand lower down placing it lower than that and instead it is on the desk rather than the rest.. but maybe I was just spolied with the Roccat Isku+ that I had previously to this with its large size.

Using the ICUE software its easy to control the lighting and does have a few options but not nearly as many as my Corsair M800 mouse pad and M55 Pro Mouse and it will not link colour mode like those either except for a solid colour option. The colour is also a little duller than those as well, but this is due the rubber the light has to passthrough under the keys.

It is a pretty decent keyboard though and seems solidly built and the macro keys and volume keys work great but I dont use the media keys so I cant really comment on those. Its also pretty quiet as most membrane keyboards are which I prefer.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Good sturdy quality. Good rgb lightning. Although the steel series fit me better, for the versatile palmrest that can be moved left to right and right to left. (magnet based)",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this looking for a keyboard that provided a good typing experience (I'm a web developer) and backlighting (I'm a web developer with a fairly dark home office). Having considered lots of alternatives, I chose the K55 on the basis that I didn't really want to spend the £150+ you'd need to spend to get a good-quality mechanical keyboard, and I haven't regretted the decision one bit.

Whilst the keyboard action is of course not as good as a proper mechanical keyboard, it's still great for typing and definitely a step up from my previous keyboard. The keys all feel very solid and typing is a pleasant experience. The backlighting is great - it's probably not quite as flexible as some of the more expensive alternatives, but in terms of looking great and allowing me to find the keys when it gets dark, it does the job perfectly.

The media controls are a useful addition (although being picky, it would have made sense to move the stop/back/play/forward keys up a few millimetres as they're a bit too close to the numeric keypad for my liking), and having six macro keys is handy for a programmer as I can use these for commonly-used bits of code.

All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase, at under £40 I think you'd struggle to find a better keyboard for the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
This product is an absolute perfect replacement for my older version of the exact same product and now you have not only made me happy but also one of my relatives who is also a streamer will now have my old one which is better than the one They have by a long shot,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic keyboard the RGBs and good but to change them with the app it doesn’t work for some reason, I just got the app but I got it not on the App Store I downloaded on the web and it works perfectly now",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Firstly, the keys feel small, and could have been designed better for use/colour transmission, but after shutting down, and restarting, the chosen lighting reverts to as it was out of the box. I don't need a show, just illumination. The tilt/elevation of the keyboard is too shallow, so placing something under it was the first thing I had to do... Not impressed - especially as I feel that is no better than a simple standard keyboard at £20. Finally, there is no 'sleep' function, so the lighting remains on ALL the time. You can press a button to turn it off, and have two dimmer settings, but to work WITH a computer would be normal.",3.0 out of 5 stars
